This documents the procedures we follow for a pysynphot release.

0. The process is begun when the release branch is created from the
trunk.

1. Check out the release branch to make changes there

2. Update version numbers on the branch and trunk.

   Note that pysynphot releases as part of stsci_python *and* as part
   of pyetc. Doublecheck the version number in the last release to
   make sure it's updated properly. 

2a.
   The version number is set in 
   pysynphot/defsetup.py
   AND
   pysynphot/lib/pysynphot/__init__.py
   AND
   pysynphot/new_config.cfg

   - on the branch: remove the .dev
   - on the trunk: increment the number by one

2b. In both branch and trunk: run the doctest and watch it fail.
   setenv PYSYN_CDBS /grp/hst/cdbs
   python
   import pysynphot
   pysynphot._test()

2c. In both branch and trunk:
    Update the doctest in pysynphot/lib/pysynphot/__init__.py to match
    the new version number. Rerun the doctest and watch it pass.

2d. In both branch and trunk:
    Commit these changes -m "Version number bump for $RELEASE_NAME"

6. On the branch:
   Remove items that we do not release, including this document:
     svn rm test/from_commissioning
     svn rm planning
     svn rm commissioning
     svn rm doc/release_checklist.txt   

7. On the branch:
   Commit these changes -m "Remove items not to be distributed"
